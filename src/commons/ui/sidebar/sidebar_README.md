# sidebar

The `sidebar` component provides a vertical navigation bar with multiple links representing different sections of the application. It dynamically generates navigation items based on the provided data array.

## Props

No props are required for this component itself as it utilizes a local reactive variable for its data.

## Usage

Here's how to include the sidebar in your Vue project:

```html
<sidebar></sidebar>
```

## Styling

The sidebar uses Flexbox for layout, ensuring items are evenly distributed and responsive. It is styled to fit the overall design of the application.
